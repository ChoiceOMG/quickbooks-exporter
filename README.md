# Quickbooks Online API - Sync your customers to your own database using TypeORM

I wanted to be able to keep an eye on all my contact information. This microservice spools up to download all the QBO customer data and put it in mysql so I can us it. 

Over time I plan to use this to keep contact information clean across all my other customer service based apps. 

Please star the repo and if there is any interest I will keep adding more.
